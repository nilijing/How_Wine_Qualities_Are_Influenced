# How_Wine_Qualities_are_influenced

In this study, I propose a data mining approach to understand how different physiochemical properties affect wine quality and to predict wine taste preferences that is based on easily available analytical tests at the certification step. Six regression techniques were applied, under a computationally efficient procedure that performs simultaneous variable and model selection. The support vector machine achieved promising results, outperforming than the others. Such a model is useful to support the oenologist wine tasting evaluations and improve wine production. Furthermore, similar techniques can help in target marketing by modeling consumer tastes from niche markets.
